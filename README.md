* **Payment History Carousel**: An auto-playing and infinitely scrolling carousel (`carousel_slider`) that displays mock credit card bills.
* **Dynamic Status UI**: Each bill card visually represents its status (**Completed**, **Failed**, **Pending**) with unique colors, icons, and text.
* **Adaptive Theming**: Full support for both **Light and Dark modes**, with a convenient toggle switch in the app bar. The entire UI color scheme adapts seamlessly.
* **State Management**: Utilizes `flutter_bloc` for robust theme state management.
